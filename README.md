# Classifiers and A bit of Keras

### The Classifiers part
This repository contains the implementations of some classifiers which we implemented as part of our ML Course and also some python notebook that demonstrate the uses of tf.keras.

As of now the Repo Contains : 

##### Python Files

1. Bayes Classifier.
2. Naive Bayes Classifier.
3. Linear Regression.

##### Jupyter Notebooks

1. A notebook titled `Capstone-Project` which is from the answer to a assignment/Capstone as done as part of a Coursera course. Which depicts the use of several functionalities of keras and tensorflow, includes the usage of callbacks, saving models and retrieving saved models, compiling and training a model, visualizing the outputs of CNN

2. The notebook titled `Functional API-Keras` shows the usage of functional API in tf.keras which helps in building "non-traditional" DL models

3. The notebook titles `Visaulizing Convolutions` helps in understanding how Conv-layers help in the task of image classification.
