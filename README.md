# Classifiers
The Repositories contains the implementations of some Classifiers which we implemented as part of our ML Course.

1. Bayes Classifier.
2. Naive Bayes Classifier.
3. Linear Regression.

# How to Use?
1. Each of the classifier is a Python class.
2. They can be instantiated as Python objects and after that we can run the `Classifier.fit()` method with the necessary arguments to the classifier.
